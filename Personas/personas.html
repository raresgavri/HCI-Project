            <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
            <p>
              Emily leads a fast-paced professional life, juggling multiple
              projects and deadlines. Her myopia has been a constant challenge,
              especially when it comes to her work tasks that require visual
              precision. Despite wearing glasses or contact lenses, she often
              experiences eye strain, headaches, and blurred vision by the end
              of the day. Emily realizes that she needs a solution to alleviate
              these issues and enhance her overall productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              She comes across an app specifically designed to assist
              individuals with visual impairments. This app offers features such
              as text resizing, a magnifier tool, and picture editing
              capabilities. Intrigued by its potential benefits, Emily decides
              to try it out. With the app, she can now easily adjust the text
              size on her smartphone or computer, allowing her to read and edit
              documents comfortably without straining her eyes. The magnifier
              tool helps her zoom in on small text or images, enabling her to
              comprehend and appreciate details that would otherwise be
              difficult to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app's picture editing features also prove to be a valuable
              asset for Emily. She can now make quick edits and enhancements to
              images, giving her greater creative control and eliminating the
              need to rely on others for assistance. This newfound independence
              allows her to complete her marketing tasks efficiently and within
              her own timeline.

          <h5>Scenarios</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scenario 1 - Document Editing: Emily is reviewing a client's
              marketing proposal on her computer. Using the app, she increases
              the text size, which significantly reduces eye strain and makes it
              easier for her to catch any errors or inconsistencies in the
              document.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scenario 2 - Image Enhancement: Emily is designing a promotional
              banner for an upcoming marketing campaign. With the app's picture
              editing tools, she can resize images, adjust brightness and
              contrast, and apply filters to create visually appealing graphics.
              This empowers Emily to maintain creative control over her projects
              and produce high-quality marketing materials without relying on
              others for assistance.

          <h5>Other Details</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Emily enjoys exploring new technologies and is open to
              incorporating assistive tools into her daily routine to improve
              her visual experience and work efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              She values her independence and is motivated to find solutions
              that allow her to overcome the challenges posed by her myopia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Emily actively seeks recommendations and advice from optometrists
              and fellow professionals who have faced similar visual challenges
              in their work.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By using the app designed to assist individuals with visual
            impairments, Emily can overcome the limitations imposed by her
            myopia. The app's text resizing, magnifier, and picture editing
            features address her specific needs and frustrations, enhancing her
            productivity and overall visual experience. Emily's ability to
            comfortably read and edit documents, magnify small text or images,
            and independently edit and enhance visuals contributes to her
            success in her marketing career while reducing eye strain and
            improving her overall well-being.

            <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
            <p>
              Alex is a talented software developer in his late thirties. He has
              been working in the field for over a decade and specializes in
              designing user interfaces and coding front-end applications.
              However, he faces challenges due to his red-green color blindness.
              This visual impairment affects his ability to accurately perceive
              certain color combinations, which is crucial when creating
              visually appealing and accessible designs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alex often encounters difficulties distinguishing between shades
              of red and green, which can lead to unintended design flaws. He
              finds it frustrating to rely on the assistance of his colleagues
              to verify color choices, as it slows down his design process and
              reduces his independence. Additionally, he feels that his
              creativity is limited, as he has to constantly consider the impact
              of his color perception on the overall design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alex is motivated to develop visually inclusive user interfaces
              that consider the needs of color-blind users. He understands the
              importance of accessibility in design and wishes to contribute
              effectively to projects. However, he requires tools that can help
              him overcome his color blindness and enhance his design skills.

          <p>
            <strong> 1. </strong> Alex is working on a new project where he
            needs to use a color palette that includes shades of red and green.
            He utilizes a color blindness simulation feature in the app to
            identify the color combinations that are difficult for him to
            distinguish. With this information, he adjusts the color palette
            accordingly to ensure a more accessible design.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. </strong> Alex is collaborating with a team on a web
            application. He uses the text resizing feature of the app to enlarge
            the font size, making it easier for him to read and review the code.
            This feature enhances his productivity and reduces the strain on his
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. </strong> Alex receives feedback on a design from a
            colleague who points out a potential issue with the color contrast.
            He uses the picture editing feature in the app to adjust the color
            values, improving the contrast and ensuring better visibility for
            color-blind users.

            He actively participates in online forums and communities dedicated
            to color blindness and accessible design.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. </strong>
            Alex is open to trying new technologies and tools that can assist
            him in overcoming his color blindness and improving his design
            skills.

            <p>
              Sarah Thompson is a 33-year-old marketing professional residing in
              Chicago. She was diagnosed with pink eye (conjunctivitis) a week
              ago, which has resulted in redness, itching, and blurry vision in
              both eyes. As a visually impaired individual during this recovery
              period, Sarah is seeking an app that can assist her in coping with
              her temporary condition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sarah's current visual impairment limits her ability to read text,
              whether on screens or printed materials. She struggles with tasks
              such as reading emails, articles, or even text messages.
              Identifying objects or recognizing faces from a distance has
              become challenging for her as well. These limitations have caused
              frustration and have made Sarah reliant on others for assistance,
              hindering her independence.
            </p>
            <p>
              To overcome these challenges, Sarah is looking for an app that
              provides accessibility features specifically designed for
              individuals with visual impairments. She needs functionality that
              allows her to resize text, magnify content, and edit pictures, as
              these features would significantly enhance her ability to engage
              with digital and printed materials. By utilizing such an app,
              Sarah hopes to alleviate the discomfort caused by conjunctivitis
              and regain her ability to perform daily tasks with greater ease
              and independence.

            <li>
              Scenario 1: Text resizing - Sarah receives an important email from
              her supervisor but struggles to read it due to her visual
              impairment. She opens the accessibility app on her smartphone and
              uses the text resizing feature to increase the font size, making
              the email content more legible. By utilizing this functionality,
              Sarah can read the email without relying on someone else to read
              it aloud, enhancing her independence and productivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scenario 2: Magnifier - Sarah needs to fill out a physical form
              for an upcoming doctor's appointment, but her blurred vision makes
              it challenging to read the small print. She opens the app on her
              smartphone and activates the magnifier feature. By hovering her
              phone's camera over the form, the app magnifies the text, enabling
              Sarah to read and fill out the form accurately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scenario 3: Picture editing - Sarah receives a document with
              important graphics that she needs to review for an upcoming client
              presentation. Due to her visual impairment, she struggles to
              discern the details and make necessary edits. Using the picture
              editing feature in the accessibility app, Sarah can enhance the
              contrast, adjust brightness, or magnify specific sections of the
              document's graphics, enabling her to make precise edits and ensure
              the final version is accessible to all.
